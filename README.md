# AI Skill Accelerator 🚀
The AI Skill Accelerator is a next generation AI powered learning platform that transforms any skill into a structured, university style curriculum using YouTube, quizzes, gamification, and NotebookLM study tools.

Enter a skill, click generate, and instantly receive a complete personalized learning pathway.
